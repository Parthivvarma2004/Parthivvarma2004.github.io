							<h3><u>Electrical and Computer Engineering Ambassador - University of Toronto: </u></h3>
							<p>ECE Ambassador is a volunteer position for Electrical and Computer engineering students to represent the department at various recruitment, outreach, and alumni activities and exclusive events held throughout the year. Ambassadors act as liaisons between the current student community and external groups such as prospective students, their parents, and alumni.
								<br>
								<u>Duties:</u><br>
								→ Positively represent the student body, and act as an ambassador to alumni, prospective students, and parents at various recruiting events, campus open houses, high school visits, and other events as assigned. <br>
								→ Assist in hosting/set-up and take-down of recruitment and outreach events on behalf of the department <br>
								→ Speaking about your personal experiences with all aspects of school life, potentially in front of large groups <br>
								→ Attend informational, training, or pre-event sessions</p>
							<h3><u>General Member for Robot Operating System (ROS) subteam - Autonomous Rover Team:</u></h3>
								<p>The Autonomous Rover Team (ART) focuses on building fully autonomous robots to perform meaningful functions, often involving navigation and environment manipulation. The members build the robot from the ground up, including its design, mechanical and electrical subsystems, navigation software, and computer vision models. The functionality is often motivated by various national and international competitions the team aims to attend towards the end of each academic year.
									<br>
									The ROS team serves as the glue between all the other sub-teams by leveraging ROS to process sensor inputs and produce appropriate motor commands to make the robot move autonomously. Early on, the ROS team uses simulation extensively to build a fully functional, competition ready robot and afterwards, focuses on migrating the code base onto the actual robot. It is an amalgamation of ROS, code development, simulation, navigation and system design!</p>
